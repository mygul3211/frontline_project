<h1>What is a computer</h1>
<p> A computer is a programmable eletronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of
instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and logical
operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The
term "computer"is derived from the latin word "computare" which means to calculate.
